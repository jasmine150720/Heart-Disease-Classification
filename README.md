# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease classification.

## What is classification?
Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (**single-class classification**). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as **multi-class classification**.

1. Problem Definition
   - Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
3. Data
   - The original data came from the Cleveland database from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
5. Preparing the tools
   There are a few which will you'll likely take advantage of during almost every structured data project.
   - `pandas` for data analysis.
   - `NumPy` for numerical operations.
   - `Matplotlib/seaborn` for plotting or data visualization.
   - `Scikit-Learn` for machine learning modelling and evaluation.
